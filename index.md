<p style="line-height:150%">
Sussex Precarious Academics (SPA) are a group of precariously employed workers across numerous schools at the University of Sussex, including Doctoral Tutors, School Tutors, fixed-term lecturers and researchers, and temporary module convenors. We have mobilised in response to the decisions being made by the University Executive Group (UEG), and the significant and immediate threat they pose to the current employment and long-term careers of precarious academics. In light of the Financial Review Guidelines and the impossibility of precarious academics to hold the UEG accountable, we consider: (i) UEG to be failing in their responsibility to provide training, nurturance, career development etc. for future generations in the profession; (ii) any self-proclaimed notions of ‘kindness’, ‘integrity’ and ‘inclusion’ stated in the UoS 2025 strategy as lacking credibility and legitimacy; (iii) UEG actions as running contrary to the UoS Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy; (iv) UEG failing to meet their obligation and responsibility to protect our health, safety and welfare. SPA intend to challenge and hold to account the UEG and their decisions, and the serious implications these will have for teaching, research and the working conditions of all staff. 
</p>
<p style="line-height:150%">
The Covid-19 crisis has put employment in every sector under great uncertainty and strain, particularly in higher education. At the University of Sussex (UoS), the deleterious effects of years of increasing marketisation and casualisation has been powerfully exposed. Whilst many universities were taking action to protect their precarious workers during the onset of the crisis, the University of Sussex Executive Group (UEG) compiled the highly insensitive and alarming Financial Review Guidelines (FRGs). Although the FRGs have been revised, they still fail to protect casualised staff, and reproduce the logic that the consequences and burden of any economic backlash will fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable staff. Not only has this added to our immediate and ongoing worries about the future, it has drained any goodwill previously held by many precariously employed academics at the university.
</p>
<p style="line-height:150%">
Precarious academics have made great progress, and take much strength, from numerous collective actions that have occurred across the university in recent years. However, such initiatives are fragmented, and the precarious nature of our work presents a significant challenge to our ability to be represented and listened to as a group. Many of us are hesitant to speak out for reasons ranging from fear of being perceived as ungrateful for the ‘favour’ and ‘opportunity’ of being offered work, to not wanting to rock the boat and risk contract extension/renewal, or being overlooked for future positions. This is particularly pertinent for those with visa obligations, reference requirements and/or financial and caring responsibilities. 
</p>
<p style="line-height:150%">
Whilst all university staff have been subject to increasing workloads, precarious academics are also faced with the indignity of increasingly casualised work, an inadequate hourly rate of pay, multipliers that grossly underestimate the actual hours worked, and no pension contributions from the university. Furthermore, impossibly stretched departments have escalated their reliance on us, and expectations of us to increase our workloads in order to deliver emergency remote teaching from home during the pandemic crisis. This is not to mention that, for a time, we also feared our employment would be terminated with immediate effect. Plans to reassign our work to permanent staff would not only reduce the future employability of precarious academics due to lost teaching experience, it will also increase the workload of permanent staff and undermine their ability to conduct research. This will also disrupt the transfer of professional skills from senior to junior academics required for the continuity of academic work as a vocation, and will jeopardise the quality of education for students.
</p>
<p style="line-height:150%">
Precarious academics are a vital part of the workforce that create significant value for the university, being responsible for the majority of frontline teaching, evaluation and interaction with students, and for a significant contribution to our research communities and positive working environments. We often step in when being called upon to plug teaching gaps at the last minute. And yet, we are continually viewed as an expendable convenience often lacking any status within the university. This can severely impact confidence and mental well-being, when we are in fact a highly skilled and capable group whose professional development is integral to a thriving academic community across generations. Growing numbers of successful permanent staff have experienced many years of precarity themselves, which points to the structural and systemic causes of precarity rather than any individual lack of talent or capability. As doctoral funding continues to shrink, and the period between PhD completion and gaining a permanent academic position is ever growing, there is a widespread expectation that we will accept casualised work, or be prepared to disrupt our lives and relocate intermittently for short-term contracts. As a result, we lack the stability to plan our lives, with the current crisis compounding our worries about future recruitment.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%">
There is no indication that this pandemic will be over any time soon, with some estimates up to 18 months. This is for the pandemic itself, and does not even reflect longer term economic impacts. As such, we appeal to all permanent staff to refuse to cover any work usually carried out by SPA, and demand from the university:</p>
 <ol>
            <li>
              Immediate revocation of the FRGs
            </li>
            <li>
              An immediate contractual guarantee of two years work, at or above current level of remuneration, for all precarious academics
            </li>
            <li>
              A commitment from UoS to consult and align with the local UCU branch on protecting precarious workers,  both academic and non-academic, including the furloughing of staff
            </li>
            <li>
              All precarious academics to be remunerated at our estimates for: (i) the cost of preparing and implementing remote teaching from home; and (ii) conducting marking two weeks later than agreed without consultation (estimates provided here)
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p style="line-height:150%">
We justify our demands on the grounds of:

          <ol>
            <li>
              The immediate distress and cost of preparing to deliver teaching remotely from home during the week of suspended teaching
            </li>
            <li>
              The ongoing distress and cost of delivering teaching remotely from home
            </li>
            <li>
              The distress, cost and lack of consultation regarding extended deadlines and related marking periods
            </li>
            <li>
              The additional value created by precarious academics
            </li>
            <li>
              The large sums of money the university has saved capitalising on the labour of precarious academics for a number of years, contributing significantly to the ‘healthy’ financial position of UoS
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If satisfactory progress is not made on our demands, we are prepared to take further action.
